                  <h3 class="concept-title">The Internet</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p><span>...is a bunch of computers</span> <em>"talking"</em> to each other!</p>
</div></div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.1B">
                  <h3 class="concept-title">The World Wide Web</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p><span>...is a large collections of interlinked files.</span> The majority of the content is contained within HTML <em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em> documents.</p>

    <p>You sit at your computer interfacing with the internet, primarily through your browser. Servers hold the information, and the info is transmitted via a protocol called HTTP.</p>
</div></div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.1C">
                  <h3 class="concept-title">HTML</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p><span>...documents are made up of the content</span> <em>(the <strong>what</strong> of it all)</em> and the markup <em>(how the "what" <strong>looks</strong>)</em>! (Ok, ok...Let's stop sounding like the caterpillar from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.)</p>
</div></div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.1D">
                  <h3 class="concept-title">Tags and Elements</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p>We learned about HTML docs being made up of elements, and we learned some tags to communicate the type of element to the browser. Some of the <strong>inline</strong> tags learned in this lesson include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span>span</span></li>

      <li><strong>strong</strong></li>

      <li><em>em</em></li>

      <li>And, of course, the br tag,<br>
      (which can help us go to the next line!)</li>

      <li>(We also learned the img tag, but let's not insert pics here yet.)</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <p>We also learned a couple block tags, including: "div" and "p". (The block tags have an "invisible box" around them.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>We took a look at the general layout of an element, which included the tag itself, the attribute(s) with their values, and for tags other than the void ones, the content within.</p>
</div></div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.1E">
                  <h3 class="concept-title">Computers are "Stupid"</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p>They just follow our instructions, even though some of those instructions might be fairly complex! (Until the robot uprising, that is! LOL.) This gives us the opportunity to wield a lot of control with our instructions. But it also means that we have to issue those instructions very accurately, or we will be pulling our hair our trying to figure out what went wrong.</p>

    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.2A">
            <h3 class="concept-title">Why did we start with HTML?</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p>Front end development provides early rewards (easy to see and understand the results of what you're doing.) We'll be using HTML and CSS (and be made aware of JavaScript), as these are building blocks for web design.</p>
</div>
</div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.2B">
                  <h3 class="concept-title">How did we practice in this section?</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
    <p>We discussed breaking down a current webpage and redeveloping it for learning purposes. We also took a look at Chrome Developer Tools in order to see the tree-like structure of a page. (This concept was illustrated by using the analogy of a family tree, where parents can have multiple children, who can have children of their own. We looked at how the tree structure in the developer tools were laid out in a series of nested boxes. The levels of the tree could be expanded and collapsed in order to understand the structure of the page.)</p>

    <p>Remember: HTML and CSS standards evolve and develop over time. But once you're proficient, it is easy to stay afloat!</p>

    <p>A preview of the coming material included: basic design mockup, css framework (and responsive design), professional framework (bootstrap, in this case).</p>

    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.3A">
      <h3 class="concept-title">Cascading Style Sheets!</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
      <p>We learned that "Cascading" refers to the fact that the most specific rule is applied. This concept is called <strong>"inheritance"</strong>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.3B">
      <h3 class="concept-title">A Word on Repetition</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
      <p><em><strong>Avoid!</strong></em></p>

      <p>Ok, let's offer more than <em><strong>a</strong></em> word! They say that lazy programmers make awesome programmers. Why? Perhaps because they do whatever they can from repeating themselves! This is cute, but it goes to the heart of avoiding repeating the same thing over and over which could introduce errors later. It also reminds us that if we want to be consistent, it is best to categorize our css into sensible classes so that it will be easy to keep like items the same, even when we want to tweak things to the overall document later.</p>

    <div class="concept" id="lesson-1.3C">
      <h3 class="concept-title">Cool Tips</h3>
<div class="concept-description">
      <p>Experiment with these options when dealing with overall sizing and placement:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>box-sizing:border-box; (a model that includes border and padding in total size.)</li>

        <li>display: flex; (allows the flow of divs to naturally appear next to each other)</li>
      </ul>
